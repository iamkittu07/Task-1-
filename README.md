# Task-1-
Road Lane Detection using OpenCV 🚗🛣️

# Project Overview
This project detects lane lines on roads using image processing techniques in Python with OpenCV. The system simulates basic lane detection similar to what autonomous vehicles use.

🛠️Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Google Colab (optional for running)

⚙️ How It Works
1. Convert road image to grayscale.
2. Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
3. Detect edges using Canny edge detection.
4. Mask the image to focus on the road region.
5. Use Hough Transform to find straight lines.
6. Draw the lane lines on the original image.
